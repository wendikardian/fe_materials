       <b> Timedoor Coding Academy </b> was founded with a goal to prepare the next generation in Indonesia with excellent IT skills. We want todayâ€™s kids not only be a user of digital technology, because we want them to be the next inventors. <u> Moreover</u>, the fast advancement on the internet and social media have brought concerns on <i><b>social</b> issues</i>, for example false news and cyber-bullying. Our dream is that the next influential technology innovators will arise from <b>Indonesia</b>. Supported by our character and digital literacy education, <u>our students</u> will spread the positive influence continuously to our society. In other words, our goal is not limited to creating leaders only in technology, but also in creating a better society
